AuthServer : Spring Authorization Server is a framework that provides implementations of the OAuth 2.1 and OpenID Connect 1.0 specifications and other related specifications. It is built on top of Spring Security to provide a secure, light-weight, and customizable foundation for building OpenID Connect 1.0 Identity Providers and OAuth2 Authorization Server products.<br/> 
<br/>
ResourceServer : In the context of OAuth 2.0, a resource server is an application that protects resources via OAuth tokens. These tokens are issued by an authorization server, typically to a client application. The job of the resource server is to validate the token before serving a resource to the client.  <br/>
